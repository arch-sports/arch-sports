# Abstract

|    The purpose of this testing was to determine the possible relationship between a history of pain/injury, tightness in various areas of the body, and countermovement jump (CMJ) force asymmetries in male high school basketball players. The test was performed in three sections. First, the athletes would perform 3 repetitions of the CMJ using force plates. Second, the athletes performed a Functional Movement Screen (FMS) Overhead Squat to assess tightness in the lats and calves. Third, the athletes performed a gator side plank on each side to assess hip strength and were assessed for quad tightness using the Ely's Test. The pain and injury history information was gathered by survey. After the test, the results were grouped by whether the athletes displayed high asymmetries in the jump metrics (>= 10%), whether they had pain, and whether they were able to successfully complete the movement assessments with or without tightness. The results were analyzed using the Fisher's Exact Test. Based on the resulting p-values from the pairwise comparisons using the Fisher's Exact Test, no groupings of results showed a statistically significant correlation.

<p>

|    The countermovement jump is an excellent measure of lower body power and explosiveness. Through the use of the Vald ForceDecks, we are able to accurately measure the force an athlete produces over time, which leads to a precise measurement of the athlete's jump height alongside a range of other useful metrics, such as peak power, the duration of different phases of the jump, and the Reactive Strength Index - Modified (mRSI).
|    One of the more useful metrics gathered from the assessment, the mRSI captures a few important characteristics of the jump into one single measurement. Calculated by dividing the Jump Height by the time to takeoff, the mRSI shows how "springy" an athlete is. While two athletes may jump the same height, one might drop down and rebound very quickly, like a powerful spring, while the other takes longer to develop that force, resulting in a lower mRSI. This provides insight into both the athlete's jump strategy but also fatigue characteristics.
|    The above graphs show the distribution of testing scores, alongside normative data from the VALD *Normative Data Report - Basketball 2022*[^1], displayed as a grey region showing the 25th to 75th percentile. Note that the normative values are gathered from collegiate athletes.

<p>

|    The Gator Plank Hip Strength assessment is a test used to evaluate the relative hip strength of an athlete in the frontal plane. Being strong enough to support one's bodyweight in the side plank position shows healthy muscular development, which should correlate with a reduced rate of injury in athletes. If the athlete was marked as "Yes," then they were able to successfully perform the assessment.

<p>

|    The Functional Movement Screen™ is a battery of several assessments that look to determine the quality of an athlete's movement patterns. While performing the entire FMS™ screen gives a more comprehensive look into an athlete's movement, the overhead squat, as a single assessment, provides a holistic look into the entire body as an entire system working together. The squat looks at an athlete's ability to reach good depth while maintaining a relatively upright posture, shoulder flexion in keeping the bar overhead, and weight balanced both between the left and right feet and over the middle of the foot. This allows the practitioner to assess the athlete's movement capabilities across the whole body at once. During this assessment, we looked at whether tightness in the calves and/or lats were the limiting factor. A 'Yes' indicates tightness in that particular area.
